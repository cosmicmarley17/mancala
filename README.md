# Mancala
A virtual mancala board game in the terminal, with hot-seat multiplayer. 

## About
This project is a work-in-progress and not in a very functional state at the moment. Yes, I have a text file for notetaking tracked in the repo. Come back later for polished, useful software.

## Goals for this project
* My goal for this project in its finalized state is to make it a Rust library crate.
* I want to modularize the project so that the game logic is separate from the implementation of a user interface. This goal is inspired by the design of [the game Veloren](https://veloren.net "Veloren").
* I'll implement at least one frontend user interface that uses my library under the hood. I might even try implementing a graphical user interface.
* Once I'm happy with the state it's in, I'll make the library open source and publish it to [crates.io](https://crates.io "crates.io: The Rust communityâ€™s crate registry"), so others can create their own mancala programs using the code I've written.
